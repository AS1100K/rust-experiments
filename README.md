# Rust Experiments

This is a mono-repo where I keep all the random stuff _(especially benchmarks and prototypes)_ written
in rust. All the crates here aren't always a complete MVP but some minor parts of the project I am
planning to work on.

> [!WARNING]
> Please don't use any of these crates in production, as they are usally unmaintained and might not be
> performance optimized. Feel free to take any code but you will be reponsible for it's maintainance.

## Crates Available

_No crates available_

<!-- TODO: Add Table of Contents for crates available -->

## License

All the crates are licensed under [MIT License](./LICENSE) unless explicitally stated in any of the
crates.

## Contributing

In short, I will most probably not accept any PRs and issues, and have even disabled them for this repository,
because this repo is just for random stuff which is not maintained and made for a specific issue in mind.
